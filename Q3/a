Execution context refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It contains all the variables, functions, and objects that the code can access at a given moment. It helps keep track of the code's execution and provides a way to handle variables, function scopes, and the call stack. The diagram below illustrates the concept of execution context:
